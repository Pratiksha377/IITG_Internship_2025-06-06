This repository includes multiple Python script such as Naive_Bayes_classifier.py,

Naive_Bayes_classifier.py implements Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier from scratch to classify Iris flower species using the UCI Iris dataset. It includes functionality for training, prediction, and evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

XOR_GATE_Implementation_using_ANN.py script implements a customizable deep neural network using NumPy to solve the XOR classification problem.
It supports multiple hidden layers, sigmoid activation, and binary cross-entropy loss.
The model is trained using gradient descent and evaluates its performance using accuracy.
